Notes:
 U3 allow perform experiments with low power (supply voltage starting from aprox. 3v)
 Do not install U3 for high power use.
 There is error in PCB pins 2 and 3 should be swapped
 J7 short 1-2 for TC4420 (no inversion), 2-3 for TC4429 (inversion)
 J3 antenna (for PLL)
 short J1 for continuous mode
 short J5 to switch off or apply interrupt signal (1-on, 0-off)
 short J6 to enable PLL
 select frequency with C1,C5
  200pf  800Khz - 1Mhz
  470pf  300 - 500Khz
  680pf  200-300Khz
